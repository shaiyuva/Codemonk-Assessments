# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Crop Production Data
Overview:
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a crop production dataset to uncover insights into agricultural patterns, yield trends, and factors influencing crop productivity.

Dataset:

The dataset contains information on various crops, their production, area harvested, and yield across different regions.
Key features include:

Crop Name
State/Region
Year
Area (in hectares)
Production (in metric tons)
Yield (Production/Area)

Objectives:

Understand the distribution of crops across different states and years.
Identify trends in crop production and yield over time.
Analyze relationships between area harvested and total production.
Detect outliers and anomalies in the data.

Steps Performed:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handling missing values.
Removing duplicates and correcting inconsistencies.
Converting data types for better analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Descriptive Statistics (mean, median, min, max, standard deviation).
Univariate Analysis: Distribution of crops, most/least produced crops.
Bivariate Analysis: Relationship between area and production.
Time Series Analysis: Trends in crop yield over the years.

Data Visualization:

Bar charts & Histograms for crop distribution.
Box plots to identify outliers in crop yield.
Heatmaps to visualize correlations between variables.
Line plots for trend analysis of production over time.

Tools & Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

Key Insights:

The most cultivated crops and their respective yields.
States with the highest and lowest agricultural productivity.
Seasonal trends in crop production.
Anomalies and irregularities in the dataset.
